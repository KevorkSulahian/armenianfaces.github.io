                    <p>Adom Yerjanian, the brilliant Armenian poet, was born in 1878, in the town of Agn, which is located in the Eastern Anatolia district of the Ottoman Empire, which is today known as the region of Kemaliye and is located on the shores of the river Euphrates. He was born and raised in Agn, Adom received his preliminary education in Agn’s famous institution, the Nersisian school. He was guided and mentored by the school’s director, Bishop Karekin Srvantsdiants, who was a famous cleric and collector of recorded cultural and traditional Armenian dialects. Karekin constantly encouraged  Adom to develop and pursue his love for poetry and literature in general, and eventually he gifted him his pen name Siamanto which was used by Adom till the rest of his life. </p>

                <p>After graduating from the Nersisian primary school, Siamanto moved to Constantinople in 1892 with his father, who worked as a merchant and as a result, never settled at a permanent address. Siamanto came from a middle class family and attended the Mirjanian school in Kum Kapu, Constantinople and then the Berberian high school in Uskudar. He graduated in 1896, the year which set the start for the Hamidian massacres. Afraid from death and persecution, he fled with his family to Egypt where he stayed for a year and went through depression because of the butchery and massacres that his fellow Armenian compatriots were facing, back in the Ottoman Empire.
After Egypt, Adom headed to Europe, where he stayed at Geneva for a short period of time, and then he finally resided in Paris in 1897. He immediately enrolled in the literature and philosophy department at the luxurious Sorbonne University. He was truly amazed by French philosophy and Middle Eastern literature, therefore he pursued his studies in both of these majors. Siamanto’s university tuition, unlike others’, was not financed by his parents, and as a result he worked at different positions to overcome his difficult financial situation. During his years as a student, Siamanto befriended many famous Armenian and French intellectuals, both inside and outside of Paris.

                <p>After finishing his studies in Paris, Siamanto decided to move to Geneva, Switzerland. During his stay, he was an active contributor to a newspaper called “Troshag” which was founded and financed by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, which was a newy founded political force at that time. As a contributor, he published his first written poems in this very newspaper, under the headlines of (Tiutzaznoren, which was his very first volume) and (Asbedin Yerke), which translate as Heroically and The Knight’s Song in English. Siamanto’s first works heavily criticized the Ottoman government. In his poems, he expressed his dissatisfaction and demanded equal rights and more autonomy for the minorities, especially Armenians. Siamanto’s nationalistic poems also mentioned his fight for the Armenian cause, and his belief that one day there will be an Armenian republic, free and liberated from Turkish governance and oppression. <br />
                During his stay in Europe, Siamanto kept a close friendship with the members of the "European Armenian Students’ Association" and with national political parties, such as, the Hnchags and ARF. <br />
                His world-view, literary and artistic inclinations were formed in this very atmosphere. In 1904, Siamanto was diagnosed with pneumonia, an inflammatory disease which affects the lung. He got his treatment at a hospital in Geneva and his health condition was eventually recovered. After the military coup, the Young Turks’ Revolution and the proclamation of the Ottoman Constitution in 1908, Siamanto, along with other Armenian activists and intellectuals returned to Constantinople after a decade of absence.

                     Siamanto started working for Azadamard, a weekly Western Armenian newspaper. However, In 1909, the ruling Turkish government, once again, threatened the Armenian community (millet) in the Ottoman Empire, by perpetrating the Adana massacre. Siamanto recorded his feelings and rage towards this planned massacre and expressed his grief and pain for his Armenian countrymen by writing a series of poems called Garmir Lourer Paregames, which translates as Red News From my Friend. This series of poems set the beginning for Siamanto’s fame, since many authors praised this collection, including Taniel Varujan, who reviewed and called it an “elegy of a genius.”
After the massacres of Adana, Siamanto left for the United States to study the lives of the Armenian diaspora, he also worked as an ARF fieldworker and was immediately appointed as the editor-in-chief of the Hayrenik Daily, a famous American-Armenian newspaper. While residing in the States, Siamanto wrote another series of poetic letters, which he titled as Hayreni Hraver, which translates as, Invitation From the Homeland. In this series, Siamanto expressed his yearn for his country and directed his series for diasporans, in order to motivate them to return and establish their lives in their homeland, Armenia.

                    <p>After 2 years and in 1911, Siamanto returned to Constantinople, where he continued his social and political activism. In 1913, and on the 1500th anniversary of the foundation of the Armenian alphabet, SIamanto published his last collection, which was dedicated to Mesrob Mashdots, the inventor of the Alphabet, and he called this volume “Saint Mesrob”. Siamanto was definitely a pioneer when it comes to Armenian poetry and literature. His style was revolutionary and innovative, he discussed death and torture, but he went beyond the pain and mixed it with hope, freedom and his dream about a better future. He never wrote about himself, and his personal life, since he always mentioned his nation, countrymen and their collective future.<br />
                        
                    Siamanto was a pioneer in Armenian poetry. His style was new and unique, and the methodology was exceptional. His themes were very dark and dealt extensively with death, torture, loss, misery, and sorrow. He recounted scenes of massacres, executions by hanging, bloody streets, pillaged villages, etc.; in other words, they dealt with the slaughter of Armenian men and women. The suffering of the people was continually tormenting him in turn. He spent many sleepless nights thinking about those who perished. Writing about their fate was his way of coping with the pain and making sure they were not killed in silence. Life for the Armenians was bleak under Ottoman rule and Siamanto’s works described that fact of life very well.

                    <p> Siamanto’s poems and writings go beyond the pain. He wrote about hope, freedom from oppression, and the possibility of a better future. His ideas also went to revolutionary themes and revenge for the murdered. Siamanto had two sides to his writing: one of lamentation, and the other of resistance. It is from this ideology of resistance that his revolutionary beliefs grew. He was convinced that the road to salvation for his people was through armed struggle. He was hoping to ignite the revolutionary spirit in the younger generation of Armenians and to make them understand that indifference and inaction was not going to save them. He was so gripped with these troubles that he seldom wrote about himself, his personal life, love, or joy.
                        <br />
                        <p>Siamanto’s revolutionary ideas and his constant demand of resistance and freedom, which were expressed not only in his acts, but in his written works as well, made him a target to the Turkish authorities. He was constantly persecuted and threatened, however, he never gave up on his ideas and he always led the fight for a cause he heartedly believed in. Siamanto was arrested by the Turkish government among many other Armenian intellectuals who were murdered on April 24, 1915.</p>
