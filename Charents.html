                <p>Since he was a child, Tumanyan recognized how terrible was the life of the Armenians and since childhood he knew that he was meant to be a writer. He was raised with the fairy tales, lore, parables and the legends of the Armenians. The beauty of Lori became an important part of his work and an inseparable part of his spiritual, in which he reflected to in his works.<br /> <br/>
The strong bond between Tumanyan and the Armenians lasted until the end of his time, even though he have spent almost all of his life in the city of Tiflis (from 1883) away from Lori.

                <p>Tumanyan started writing at an early age, when he was around 10-11 years old, but only became famous as a poet in 1890, during the debut of his first poetry collection. Even in his early works, everyone felt the freshness and uniqueness that Tumanyan had brought to the Armenian literature. </p>

                     Tumanyan got his inspiration from the everyday activities of the ordinary people. The main characters of his works usually were simple villagers.<br />
                     He showed similar qualities in his heroes as indestructible strength of thought, beauty and richness of feelings, wisdom and depth.<br />
                     In his work, Tumanyan showed the harsh Life of the villagers who undertook unfair patriarchal laws, prejudice, unjust, and oppression. Facing these difficulties, Tumanyan’s heroes most of the time die a tragic death. While painting these sad realities, Tumanyan, also at the same time, portrays and exposes real poetry, purity of feelings, sincerity, and indestructible determination for justice in his heroes. The images created by Tumanyan could move the reader even today with their realistic reality, but especially move the reader delicately to profound compassion for truth and beauty in the human experience.

                    <p> Greatest contribution of Tumanyan toward the Armenian literature that is rarely mentioned is the fact the he used and encouraged other writers to use folklore of other nations. He cleverly used folk images, plots and motives from different cultures and popularized them into the Armenian literature without imitation, and without repetition. He selected material from diverse folk sources, adjusting them in his own creative way and made a completely different work of art. <br />
                        Tumanyan always placed his principles of integrity and ideals into each of his literary adaptations of folk art. Based on various versions of the Armenian epos he wrote the “David of Sassoon” epic poem, Tumanyan made one of his masterpieces – “The Capture of the Tmuk Fortress,” a poem, which is about beauty and immortality. It celebrates patriotism and the strength of love, which is capable of inspiring an act of great achievement and an act of great courage.

                    <p> “Nazar the Brave” – a tale that Tumanyan wrote using about 20 versions of the same story, including non-Armenian versions. This tale makes fun of those people who idolize undeserving people and raise them into ruling class. Later these characters start wars, spread violence and tyranny and people usually suffer because of them. The tale is exceptional for its sharp sarcasm, keen and brilliant detailed observations, and its depth and wisdom. Tumanyan himself, who always evaluated his creative work humbly, believed that the tale was ready to present itself for judgment of the entire literary world. In addition, he was right of course, “Nazar the Brave” turned out to be one of his most successful work, and until today, people read and relate to it.</p>
