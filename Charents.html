                    Yeghishe Charents (1897-1937), also known as Yeghishe Soghomonyan, was born on March 13th of 1897 in Kars. <br />
                    For a long time Charents’ place of birth had become the talk of most philologists. Because a Persian passport was found in his documents, and in that passport his birthplace was the Persian city Maku. In 1919 Charents and his friend decide to go to the newly opened Armenian schools of Kars to become teachers. According to the laws of the Republic of Armenia millitary conscripts were not allowed to become teachers and that is why Charents and his friend used Apgar Agha’s (Charents’ father) connections to acquire Persian passports. <br />

                        Yeghishe was a poet, writer and a public activist. He was an outstanding poet of 20th century, he wrote about various subjects from his WW1 experiences, socialist revolution and also about Armenia and Armenians. 
                        <br />
                        His legacy remains and the new Republic of Armenia’s 1000 drams honors Charents memory by carrying his photo on one side. <br />
                       He attended an Armenian elementary school but he was transferred to a Russian technical secondary school in Kars. He loved reading and he admired Vahan Terian, the first book he read was Terian’s Poems which he bought with money he had taken from his father without his permission.  <br />
                        He supported communism and even joined the Bolshevik party, but during Stalin’s terrors in 1930 he slowly became disenchanted with Stalinism and he died during the Great Purge of the 1930s.

                <p>Tumanyan started writing at an early age, when he was around 10-11 years old, but only became famous as a poet in 1890, during the debut of his first poetry collection. Even in his early works, everyone felt the freshness and uniqueness that Tumanyan had brought to the Armenian literature. </p>

                     Tumanyan got his inspiration from the everyday activities of the ordinary people. The main characters of his works usually were simple villagers.<br />
                     He showed similar qualities in his heroes as indestructible strength of thought, beauty and richness of feelings, wisdom and depth.<br />
                     In his work, Tumanyan showed the harsh Life of the villagers who undertook unfair patriarchal laws, prejudice, unjust, and oppression. Facing these difficulties, Tumanyan’s heroes most of the time die a tragic death. While painting these sad realities, Tumanyan, also at the same time, portrays and exposes real poetry, purity of feelings, sincerity, and indestructible determination for justice in his heroes. The images created by Tumanyan could move the reader even today with their realistic reality, but especially move the reader delicately to profound compassion for truth and beauty in the human experience.
