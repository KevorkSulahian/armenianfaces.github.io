                    <p> William Saroyan was one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century.  He was incredibly talented, he wrote novels, plays, songs, and short stories. His stories made an important impact during the Great Depression. His characters spoke of love, joy and brotherhood in time of despair. His stories celebrated the joy of living life in spite of poverty and insecurity. He mostly wrote stories about the people he met and the places he visited, he also created a sense of community and value of life in all of his stories.
<br />Saroyan was born in Fresno, California in 1908. When he was only 3 years old, his father died. Saroyan was later placed in an orphanage with his brother and sister. In his writings, he describes his experience at the orphanage. Throughout his life, Saroyan continued his education on his own. To Saroyan, nothing made much sense in the world. He was mainly concerned with the goodness of human beings and their experiences. His best-known works are “The Time of Your Life”, “My Name is Aram” and “My Heart’s in the Highlands.

                <p>Saroyan published his first book “The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze” at the age of 26. The story was about his own life and was taken from his personal experiences. The book brought worldwide attention to the problems which Armenians in Fresno were facing. In 1943 “The Human Comedy” was published which he dedicated to his mother. In the virtue of this book, Saroyan won the Academy Award for best writing original screen story. The play “Time of Your Life” was Saroyan’s next big step. The Pulitzer Prize for Drama was given to him but he refused the prize for himself. He said, “Art must be democratic but at the same time it must be both proud and aloof. It must not be taken in by either praise or criticism.” (Saroyan, 1968) He believed that art should not be given awards and especially by the wealthy and rich who did not understand art.
<b />Saroyan was one of the first writers to put Fresno on the map of the world. He once claimed that the ten most important years of his life were the ones he spent in Fresno and that is why his story begins and ends in Fresno, California. To him, Fresno was the best city in California. He elicited nostalgia and honor to Fresno because it was the only place where he felt a strong connection to, Saroyan developed a strong connection between himself and Fresno and he liked it. He used this connection as a reference in many of his books and thus, when you read Saroyan, you read part of Fresno’s history. He is always full of emotions when he recalls memories of his Fresno childhood. Children appear in every major book he wrote and they are among his best drawn characters. In 1966, the William Saroyan theatre in Fresno was named after him
<b />Although Saroyan loved Fresno, he could never forget about his homeland Armenia. He always considered himself as an Armenian writer and he was proud of his identity. “Although I write in English, and despite the fact that I’m from America, I consider myself an Armenian writer. The words I use are in English, the surroundings I write about are American, but the soul, which makes me write, is Armenian. This means I am an Armenian writer and deeply love the honor of being a part of the family of Armenian writers.” (Saroyan W. , 1976) said Saroyan, and there are no better words to describe him, but his own.
<b />Armenia was always in Saroyan’s heart and he was devastated to witness the suffering of his own people. He wrote about Armenia as the great and powerful nation it truly is. “I love Armenia and I love America and I belong to both but I am only this: An inhabitant of the earth, so are you whoever you are. My birth place is California but I couldn’t forget Armenia. I should like to see any power of the world destroy this race, this small tribe of unimportant people whose history is ended, whose wars have all been fought and lost, whose structures have crumbled, whose literature is unread, whose music is unheard, whose prayers are no longer answered.” (Saroyan W. , Saroyan Quotes, 1972) In his writing, he gives hope to Armenians, he tells them that no power can destroy the Armenian race because Armenians have always fought and lost through centuries but they never gave up on their religion and identity.

                <p>The Great Writer passed away at the age of 72 in 1981. He was a true hero to both Armenians and Americans. According to his will, half his ashes were shipped to Armenia and a part of his heart was buried at the feet of Ararat near Bitlis town which was the homeland of his parents. 
<br />William Saroyan plays a big role in Armenian literature. Today, Armenians remember him as the great writer who influenced not hundreds but thousands of Armenians. Now, a part of Saroyan’s heart rests in peace among the Armenians. Armenian students both in Armenia and the diaspora read his works and learn his poems. Almost 4 decades after his death, he still inspires Armenians to be proud of their identity and always create a “New Armenia.”

                     Tumanyan got his inspiration from the everyday activities of the ordinary people. The main characters of his works usually were simple villagers.<br />
                     He showed similar qualities in his heroes as indestructible strength of thought, beauty and richness of feelings, wisdom and depth.<br />
                     In his work, Tumanyan showed the harsh Life of the villagers who undertook unfair patriarchal laws, prejudice, unjust, and oppression. Facing these difficulties, Tumanyan’s heroes most of the time die a tragic death. While painting these sad realities, Tumanyan, also at the same time, portrays and exposes real poetry, purity of feelings, sincerity, and indestructible determination for justice in his heroes. The images created by Tumanyan could move the reader even today with their realistic reality, but especially move the reader delicately to profound compassion for truth and beauty in the human experience.

                    <p> Greatest contribution of Tumanyan toward the Armenian literature that is rarely mentioned is the fact the he used and encouraged other writers to use folklore of other nations. He cleverly used folk images, plots and motives from different cultures and popularized them into the Armenian literature without imitation, and without repetition. He selected material from diverse folk sources, adjusting them in his own creative way and made a completely different work of art. <br />
                        Tumanyan always placed his principles of integrity and ideals into each of his literary adaptations of folk art. Based on various versions of the Armenian epos he wrote the “David of Sassoon” epic poem, Tumanyan made one of his masterpieces – “The Capture of the Tmuk Fortress,” a poem, which is about beauty and immortality. It celebrates patriotism and the strength of love, which is capable of inspiring an act of great achievement and an act of great courage.

                    <p> “Nazar the Brave” – a tale that Tumanyan wrote using about 20 versions of the same story, including non-Armenian versions. This tale makes fun of those people who idolize undeserving people and raise them into ruling class. Later these characters start wars, spread violence and tyranny and people usually suffer because of them. The tale is exceptional for its sharp sarcasm, keen and brilliant detailed observations, and its depth and wisdom. Tumanyan himself, who always evaluated his creative work humbly, believed that the tale was ready to present itself for judgment of the entire literary world. In addition, he was right of course, “Nazar the Brave” turned out to be one of his most successful work, and until today, people read and relate to it.</p>

                    <p>     Hovhannes Tumanyan has played a great role in developing the Armenian literature. He portrayed the Armenian people’s national character, the history of Armenians, their thoughts, and their most important ideals clearly through his writings. <br />
                    Tumanyan’s work gave inspiration for many Armenian writers, Tumanyan inspired Charents himself, like many other writers that took the path that Tumanyan made for them. <br />
                        Readers around the world and especially Armenians will forever carry the words and the wisdom of Hovhannes Tumanyan in their hearts and minds
