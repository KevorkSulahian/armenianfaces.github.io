                     Tumanyan got his inspiration from the everyday activities of the ordinary people. The main characters of his works usually were simple villagers.<br />
                     He showed similar qualities in his heroes as indestructible strength of thought, beauty and richness of feelings, wisdom and depth.<br />
                     In his work, Tumanyan showed the difficult life of the villagers who undertook unfair patriarchal laws, prejudice, unjust, and oppression. Facing these difficulties, Tumanyan’s heroes usually face a tragic death. While painting these sad realities, Tumanyan simultaneously portrays and exposes real poetry, purity of feelings, sincerity, and indestructible determination for justice in his heroes. The images created by Tumanyan could moves the reader delicately to create a profound compassion for truth and beauty in the human experience.

                    <p> The greatest contribution of Tumanyan towards the Armenian literature, that is rarely mentioned, is the fact the he used and encouraged other writers to use folklore of other nations. He cleverly used folk images, plots and motives from different cultures and popularized them into the Armenian literature without imitating, and without repetition. He selected material from diverse folk sources, adjusting them in his own creative way and made a completely different work of art. <br />
                        Tumanyan always placed his principles of integrity and ideals into each of his literary adaptations of folk art. Based on various versions of the Armenian epos he wrote the “David of Sassoon” epic poem, Tumanyan made one of his masterpieces – “The Capture of the Tmuk Fortress,” a poem, which is about beauty and immortality. It celebrates patriotism and the strength of love, which is capable of inspiring an act of great achievement and an act of great courage.

                    <p> “Nazar the Brave” – a tale that Tumanyan wrote using about 20 versions of the same story, including non-Armenian versions. This tale makes fun of those people who idolize undeserving people and raise them into ruling class. Later these characters start wars, spread violence and tyranny and people usually suffer because of them. The tale is exceptional for its sharp sarcasm, keen and brilliant detailed observations, and its depth and wisdom. Tumanyan himself, who always evaluated his creative work humbly, believed that the tale was ready to present itself for judgment of the entire literary world. In addition, he was right of course, “Nazar the Brave” turned out to be one of his most successful work, and until today, people read and relate to it.</p>
