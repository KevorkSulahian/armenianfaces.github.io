                    <p>Hagop Baronian (1842-1891) was Western Armenian satirist who lived and died in poverty and harsh conditions. The absence of Baronian’s full biography is one of the biggest shortcomings of the Armenian literary history. The genius satirist was unfortunate both in his life and his death, because of uncertain circumstances, which caused the loss of not only his personal archives, but also his grave. </p>

                <p>But from what we actually do know about one of, if not the greatest satirist in Armenian literature is that he was born in 1842, in Adrianople, where he attended the Arshakunyats Armenian National school. In 1857, he got accepted to the Greek school of Adrianople, but he soon discontinued his studies and took on self-education. In 1863, his literary curiosity drove him to move to Constantinople. There, he met Haroutioun Svajian, and became an editor in his newspaper “Meghoo”, which means “bee” in Armenian. He also made his contribution to other publications such as “Pogh Aravodian”, “Yeprad”, “Tadron”, “Dzidzagh”, “Khigar”, “Masis”, “Louyce”, “Hairenik”, “Jeridei Sharkieh”, and “Manzoumei Efkiar”. But financial deprivations him followed around his entire life, most of these publications were closed down by the government, and in addition to being an editor/columnist, the 47 year old beloved satirist was also forced to simultaneously work as an accountant and a teacher of accounting, while all the time despising mathematics. According to Hr. Assadour’s accounts of Baronian, “He was the first in his class when it came to linguistics, but he was not that good in mathematics. One day, the teacher calls him up to the board to solve a complicated fractions problem, which he fails to do. That makes him sad and angry, but he takes advantage of the fact that the teacher is not paying attention, and he writes on the board “Հրաժարիմք ի դիւաբանութենե և յամենայն չար կոտորակած նորա”  (renounce mathematics and the evilest of fractions) and he goes back to his place. All the students start laughing, the teacher sees the writing, and punishes Baronian.” This is a symbolic account not only in that it shows Baronian’s sense of humor from early on in his life, but also shows his hatred for mathematics, despite which he excelled at accounting later on, simply to maintain a below average living standard.<br /> <br/>
                Baronian was perhaps the most sharp-witted and boldest Armenian satirist of all time, who pointed out everything and everyone that was flawed in the reality of the second half of the 19th century, be it relating to the political or social life, and those visible to the public eye at the time quivered in fear at the thought of him. Despite all that, he was described as being incredibly gullible and naive. And despite being gifted with the rare talent of creating explosive laughter amongst his readers, he was extremely melancholic. They say that he enjoyed listening to sad oriental melodies, and from time to time, even played the kanun (an oriental musical instrument) himself. They say that he enjoyed the company of simple people, and often started conversations with them on the streets.

                    Baronian’s literary work began with dramaturgy. His first attempt was a comedy called “The Servant with Two Masters” (1865), followed by the “Oriental Dentist” (1868). The most prominent style of his work is journalistic satire, within the scope of which he has written works such as “Stings” (1878), and “Hoshos’s Handbook” (1880), where he had reflected on the majority of the notable events around that time.<br />
                     “A Tour in the Streets of Polis” (1880) includes 34 chapters, each one telling the story of one of the 34 neighborhoods in Polis. Using his sharp sense of humor and mockery techniques, the satirist writes about the habits and customs of the bourgeoisie, their negative tendencies, and the way that the upper class was out of touch with the rest of the people. In the story, everything is imperfect, everyone lives in their own bubble, without being aware of their connection to the other neighborhoods, and the only way to achieve a national life in the area is to unify the neighborhoods. <br />
                     Another one of people’s all-time favorites is “The Perils of Politeness” (1886). It is a 19-part series of different everyday situations that people encounter. The situations are pitiful in nature, but are presented in a hilarious way. The fact of the matter is that the situations represent the worst of the Armenian culture, and they portray the protagonists as victims of xenomania (otaramolutyun) and deception, victimized by the fake norms of politeness that lack individuality and uniqueness.<br />
                     “Azgayin Chocher” (1880), which roughly translates into “National Bigwigs” is considered to be the epitome of his satirical brilliance. In the preamble of the book, Baronian writes, that his aim is not to make the readers laugh, but show the flaws of the publicly visible figures in their community by documenting their biography with a degree of impartiality that would be required from a professional biographer, while at the same time maintaining the satirical element that makes him the unique literary figure that he is. <br />
                     One of the best works of Armenian dramaturgy is “Baghdasar Aghpar” (1886), which revolves around the ethics of the Armenian family. The plot is about the problematic marriage of an unfaithful wife, and her betrayed husband. What makes this work unique is the importance of the problems that it addresses, the clever solutions that are provided for the problems encountered, the underlying hilarity of the situations, and the relatable and convincing characters, who try to conceal the truth from Baghdasar, by trapping him in fraud and intrigue.<br />
                     Lastly, “The Honorable Beggars” (1887) is one of the Armenian prose classics. The character that is central to the shenanigans is Apisoghom Agha, who finds his way from Trebizond to Constantinople, for the purpose of finding a suitable wife. Apisoghom Agha is a wealthy Armenian, deprived of emotional and intellectual curiosity, and indifferent towards the destiny of humanity, or even his nation, for that matter. The only thing that is of interest to him is his own well-being. As the story evolves, he encounters the so called “honorable beggars”, who are emotionally “bankrupt”, who have lost their self-respect and identity given the socially harsh circumstances they have been forced to live in, and are ready to do anything and everything to earn a few pennies from the elite class. These individuals claim to represent the Armenian “intellectual” community, Apisoghom Agha is approached by a priest, a poet, a doctor, a teacher, a photographer, a journalist, a lawyer, and an actor, and each of them is able to deceive him into paying them what they want, and then some more. The novel comprehensively addresses the painful issues that faced the Armenians in Turkey at that point in time.

                    <p> Near the end of his life, the satirist was exhausted and hopeless. He was suffering from tuberculosis, which was eating away at him one day at a time. Baronian was not afraid of death, he was certain that the future generation would immortalize his memory, and that they were yet to talk about him and tell his story. The disease took his life on the 27th of May, 1891 in Constantinople. They buried him in the Armenian cemetery of Istanbul, but unfortunately no one has been able to precisely identify the location of his grave.
