                <p>Terian mostly wrote about nature, especially describing the season of autumn. He extensively discussed his personal life, while beautifully describing his love affairs. His selection of this particular topics, eventually acquired the title of “Singer of the Autumn.”  That's why Teryan is known as "Singer of Autumn" in Literature. <br />
                    His first collection of poems was called “Twilight Dreams,” and he published it while residing in Tbilisi in 1908. This very first published volume was considered a huge success, and was renown for its originality in creating a mixture of sadness, pain, spring and passionate love. The fate of his nation and the destiny of his homeland became an important element of Terian’s poetry and were evident in every single piece of his written works. These mentioned elements became the foundation for numerous songs which were adapted and interpreted from Terian’s poems.

                    Terian dropped out of the Moscow University in 1913 and decided to attend the St. Petersburg University and eventually majored in one of his beloved topics, which was Oriental Studies.<br />
                   In 1916, a collection of  poems by Vahan Terian with the title Land of Nairi (in Armenian: (Yerkir Nairi) was published, in which he uses Nairi in place of Armenia. Likewise in 1923, Yeghishe Charents wrote a satirical novella entitled Land of Nairi, using once again Nairi as a synonym for Armenia. <br />
                  Vahan Terian has definitely marked a new beginning for modern Eastern Armenian poetry. He influenced a wide circle of both Eastern and Western Armenian poets as well. He was constantly praised by Hovhannes Tumanian, who described him as “The most original poetical voice of his age.”<br />
               
Vahan Terian was also considered to be a pioneer in arranging Eastern Armenian poetry in specific volumes and collections. He divided his collections into different chapters, however, he unified them with their commonly shared feelings, attitudes, moods and aspects. Terian’s poems are full with sorrow, love, sufferings and joy.
<br />
                    The theme of sadness and suffering are also evident in both of his collections: “Night Remembrance” and “The Golden Legend.” Since, both of these volumes set their start by singing a remedy of sad autumn notes and melodies and descriptively portraying a scenery of the perishing nature. However, this theme is eventually stirred and the collections end with joyful songs about spring. Meanwhile, the heroic protagonist of these collections is an individual who is attempting to live a normal life, away from the difficult conditions of human life.
Terian dedicated his love songs to women and he described them as “gentle eulogies.” His poems marked pure sensual beauty and he reflected on his traumatic experiences, which are full of painful sentiments.

                     As an executive member of the Central Executive Committee of Soviet Russia, Terian was assigned with different missionary fieldworks, however, his illness prevented him from travelling around. He eventually resided in Orenburg, Russia, where he passed away on January 7, 1920 at the age of 35.
